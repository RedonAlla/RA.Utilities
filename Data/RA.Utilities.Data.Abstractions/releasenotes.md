# Release Notes for RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions

## Version 1.0.0-preview.6.3

This is the initial release of `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions`, a core library that provides essential abstractions for building a decoupled and testable data access layer. It introduces standard interfaces for the Repository and Unit of Work patterns.

### âœ¨ Key Features

*   **`IRepository<T>` Interface**:
    *   Defines a standard contract for generic repository operations (e.g., `GetByIdAsync`, `AddAsync`, `Update`, `Delete`).
    *   Promotes a consistent data access pattern across the application.
    *   Designed to work with entities that implement `IEntity<TKey>` from the `RA.Utilities.Data.Entities` package.

*   **`IUnitOfWork` Interface**:
    *   Provides a contract for managing transactions and persisting changes across multiple repositories.
    *   Includes a `SaveChangesAsync()` method to commit all changes in a single, atomic operation, ensuring data integrity.

*   **Decoupling**: By depending on these abstractions instead of concrete data access technologies (like Entity Framework Core), your application and business logic remain persistence-ignorant, making them easier to test and maintain.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

1.  **Reference the Package**: Add `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions` to your application or domain layer.
2.  **Depend on Interfaces**: Inject `IRepository<T>` and `IUnitOfWork` into your services or CQRS handlers.
3.  **Implement in Infrastructure**: Create concrete implementations of these interfaces in your infrastructure layer (e.g., using `RA.Utilities.Data.EntityFramework`).

This package forms the foundation of a clean data access strategy, enabling a more robust and scalable application architecture.
