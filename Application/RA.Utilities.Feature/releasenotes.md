# Release Notes for RA.Utilities.Feature

## Version 1.0.0-preview.6.3

This release focuses on significant documentation improvements, code example corrections, and enhanced clarity to make the library easier to understand and use. The core functionality of the package remains the same, but the guidance on how to implement it has been substantially improved.

### ‚ú® New Features & Improvements

*   **Improved Documentation**: The `README.md` file has been overhauled for clarity, consistency, and accuracy.
*   **Corrected Usage Examples**: The code examples in the `README.md` now correctly demonstrate the use of the `BaseHandler<TRequest, TResponse>` class provided by this package, instead of MediatR's `IRequestHandler`. This makes the purpose of the base handlers much clearer.
*   **Standardized DI Registration**: The dependency injection example has been updated to use the standard and widely recognized registration methods (`AddMediatR`, `AddValidatorsFromAssembly`), making it easier for developers to integrate the package into their projects.
*   **Updated Installation Guide**: The installation instructions now correctly include the necessary peer dependencies: `MediatR` and `FluentValidation.DependencyInjectionExtensions`.

### üêõ Bug Fixes

*   **Corrected Logo Image**: Fixed a broken image link in the `README.md` to ensure the package logo displays correctly on NuGet and GitHub.

### üìù Notes

The primary goal of this update is to enhance the developer experience. By providing accurate and easy-to-follow documentation, we aim to help users get up and running with Vertical Slice Architecture and CQRS patterns more quickly and effectively.
