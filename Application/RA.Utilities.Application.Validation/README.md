`RA.Utilities.Application.Validation` package is designed to provide utility validators for incoming requests.

Its primary purpose is to use the [`FluentValidation`](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) library to handle validation logic within an application.
The package tags include `validation` and `fluentvalidation`, which further confirms its role.

In short, it's a dedicated project within the `RA.Utilities` solution for centralizing request validation using [`FluentValidation`](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/).
