Add `MustMatchesCurrencyFormat` extension method. This design allows developers to chain this custom validation rule into any string property within their [`FluentValidation`](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/) validator classes.

This change updates the project version from `10.0.0-rc.2` to `10.0.0`, marking the transition from a release candidate to a stable release. This indicates that the application is now considered stable and ready for production use after completing testing and validation of the previous release candidate version.

This release modernizes the `RA.Utilities.Feature` package, providing a foundational toolkit for implementing the **Vertical Slice Architecture** pattern using CQRS. It offers base handlers, validation behaviors, and seamless integration with the `Result<T>` type to streamline feature development.

### ✨ New Features & Improvements

*   **Base Handlers for CQRS**:
    *   Provides abstract base classes (`BaseHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`) that encapsulate common logic like logging and exception handling.
    *   Handlers automatically catch exceptions and wrap them in a `Result.Failure`, ensuring robust error handling without boilerplate `try-catch` blocks.

*   **Automatic Validation Pipeline Behavior**:
    *   Includes a `ValidationBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` for MediatR pipelines.
    *   Automatically intercepts incoming requests, finds the corresponding `FluentValidation` validator, and executes it.
    *   If validation fails, the pipeline is short-circuited, and a `Result.Failure` containing a `ValidationException` is returned immediately, preventing invalid data from reaching your business logic.

*   **Seamless `Result<T>` Integration**:
    *   Designed from the ground up to work with the `Result<T>` type from `RA.Utilities.Core`, promoting explicit and predictable error handling for business logic failures.

*   **Updated Documentation**:
    *   The `README.md` has been updated to provide a clear, step-by-step guide for creating a complete feature slice, including the command, validator, handler, and DI registration.

### 🚀 Getting Started

Register MediatR, the validation behavior, and your validators in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1. Add MediatR and register handlers
builder.Services.AddMediatR(cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()));

// 2. Add the validation pipeline behavior from this package
builder.Services.AddTransient(typeof(IPipelineBehavior<,>), typeof(ValidationBehavior<,>));

// 3. Scan and register all FluentValidation validators
builder.Services.AddValidatorsFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```
