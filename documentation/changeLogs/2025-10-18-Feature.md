## Version 10.0.0-rc.2
[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-10.0.0--rc.2-orange?logo=nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Feature/10.0.0-rc.2)

This release modernizes the `RA.Utilities.Feature` package, providing a foundational toolkit for implementing the **Vertical Slice Architecture** pattern using CQRS. It offers base handlers, validation behaviors, and seamless integration with the `Result<T>` type to streamline feature development.

### âœ¨ New Features & Improvements

*   **Base Handlers for CQRS**:
    *   Provides abstract base classes (`BaseHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`) that encapsulate common logic like logging and exception handling.
    *   Handlers automatically catch exceptions and wrap them in a `Result.Failure`, ensuring robust error handling without boilerplate `try-catch` blocks.

*   **Automatic Validation Pipeline Behavior**:
    *   Includes a `ValidationBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>` for MediatR pipelines.
    *   Automatically intercepts incoming requests, finds the corresponding `FluentValidation` validator, and executes it.
    *   If validation fails, the pipeline is short-circuited, and a `Result.Failure` containing a `ValidationException` is returned immediately, preventing invalid data from reaching your business logic.

*   **Seamless `Result<T>` Integration**:
    *   Designed from the ground up to work with the `Result<T>` type from `RA.Utilities.Core`, promoting explicit and predictable error handling for business logic failures.

*   **Updated Documentation**:
    *   The `README.md` has been updated to provide a clear, step-by-step guide for creating a complete feature slice, including the command, validator, handler, and DI registration.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Register MediatR, the validation behavior, and your validators in `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1. Add MediatR and register handlers
builder.Services.AddMediatR(cfg => cfg.RegisterServicesFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly()));

// 2. Add the validation pipeline behavior from this package
builder.Services.AddTransient(typeof(IPipelineBehavior<,>), typeof(ValidationBehavior<,>));

// 3. Scan and register all FluentValidation validators
builder.Services.AddValidatorsFromAssembly(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
```
