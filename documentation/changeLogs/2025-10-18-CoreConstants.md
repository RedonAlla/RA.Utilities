### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Expanded `BaseResponseMessages`**:
    *   Added new constants for `Created`, `Updated`, `Deleted`, `Forbidden`, and `Conflict` to provide a more comprehensive set of standard messages.
    *   Improved the wording of existing messages for better clarity (e.g., `Success`, `BadRequest`, `NotFound`).
*   **Refined `ResponseType` Enum**:
    *   Removed the `Database` member to abstract away implementation details from the API contract, promoting a cleaner separation of concerns.
    *   Removed the redundant `Unknown` member, as `Error` serves as a better general-purpose error type.
*   **Improved Documentation**:
    *   The `README.md` has been significantly updated to accurately reflect all available constants in `BaseResponseCode`, `BaseResponseMessages`, `HeaderParameters`, and the `ResponseType` enum.
    *   Added clear tables and usage examples to improve the developer experience.

### üìù Notes

The goal of this update is to make the `RA.Utilities.Core.Constants` package a more robust and self-documenting source of truth for your application's core values. These changes ensure that developers have a consistent and predictable set of constants for building API responses and handling HTTP headers.
