### ðŸš€ Features & Enhancements

*   **Introduced `ICurrentUser` Interface**: The `AppUser` class now implements the `ICurrentUser` interface. This promotes dependency on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, making services that use this utility much easier to unit test.
*   **Improved Dependency Injection**: The `AddAppUser` extension method has been renamed to `AddCurrentUser`. It now registers the service against the `ICurrentUser` interface, aligning with best practices.
*   **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added detailed user guides for all public components, including usage examples and API references:
    *   `AppUser` & `ICurrentUser`
    *   `ClaimsPrincipalExtensions`
    *   `DependencyInjectionExtensions`
