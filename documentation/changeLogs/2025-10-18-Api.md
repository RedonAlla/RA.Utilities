## Version 10.0.0-rc.2
[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/badge/NuGet-10.0.0--rc.2-orange?logo=nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Api/10.0.0-rc.2)

This release modernizes the `RA.Utilities.Api` package, introducing a suite of tools to build robust, consistent, and maintainable ASP.NET Core APIs. Key features include a .NET 8 global exception handler, helpers for standardized success responses, and a clean pattern for endpoint registration.

### ✨ New Features & Improvements

*   **Global Exception Handling (`AddRaExceptionHandling`)**:
    *   Introduced a .NET 8 `IExceptionHandler` implementation that automatically catches exceptions and transforms them into standardized JSON error responses.
    *   Catches semantic exceptions from `RA.Utilities.Core.Exceptions` (e.g., `NotFoundException`, `ConflictException`) and maps them to the correct HTTP status codes (404, 409, etc.).
    *   Handles any unhandled exceptions by returning a generic 500 Internal Server Error to prevent leaking sensitive information.

*   **Endpoint Registration Helpers (`AddEndpoints` & `MapEndpoints`)**:
    *   Provides a clean pattern for organizing API endpoints into separate files using the `IEndpoint` interface.
    *   Keeps `Program.cs` clean and maintainable by automatically discovering and registering all endpoint implementations in your project.

*   **Standardized Success Response Helpers (`SuccessResponse`)**:
    *   Added a new static `SuccessResponse` class with helper methods (`Ok`, `Created`, `NoContent`, etc.).
    *   These helpers simplify the creation of successful API responses and automatically wrap the payload in the standard `SuccessResponse<T>` model, ensuring consistency with error responses.

*   **Seamless `Result<T>` Integration**:
    *   The `SuccessResponse` helpers and the exception handling middleware work together to provide a clean way to handle the `Result<T>` type from `RA.Utilities.Core`.
    *   Use the `Match` method on a `Result` to map success outcomes to `SuccessResponse.Ok()` and failure outcomes directly to an exception that the middleware will handle.

*   **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    *   The `README.md` has been completely rewritten to provide clear, step-by-step instructions and usage examples for all major features.

### 🚀 Getting Started

Register the services in your `Program.cs`:

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

builder.Services.AddRaExceptionHandling();
builder.Services.AddEndpoints();

var app = builder.Build();

app.UseRaExceptionHandling();
app.MapEndpoints();
```
