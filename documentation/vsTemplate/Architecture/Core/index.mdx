The Core folder in this the heart of the application and contains its central business logic.
It is intentionally isolated from external concerns like databases, user interfaces, or third-party services.
This separation makes the application more modular, scalable, and easier to maintain.

The `Core` folder is divided into two main projects:

  * `RaTemplate.Domain`: This project holds the core business logic and data structures of the application.
  It includes entities, value objects, and business rules.
  This layer is the innermost part of the architecture and has no dependencies on any other project in the solution.

  * `RaTemplate.Application`: This project orchestrates the use cases of the application by using the domain objects. 
  t contains the application-specific business logic, defining what the application can do.
  It depends on the `Domain` layer but remains independent of the `Infrastructure` and `Web` layers.
  It often includes features like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) handlers and interfaces that are implemented by outer layers.

In summary, the Core folder encapsulates all the business-critical logic, ensuring it remains pure and independent of any specific technology implementation.
