The `IDbContext` interface serves as a crucial abstraction layer for your database context (like Entity Framework's `DbContext`).
Even though it's an empty "marker" interface, it plays a vital role in creating a decoupled and testable application architecture.

## üß† Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its purpose:

#### 1. Decoupling from a Specific ORM:
By having your repositories depend on `IDbContext` instead of a concrete class like [`Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.entityframeworkcore.dbcontext?view=efcore-9.0), your data access logic is no longer tied directly to Entity Framework.
This adheres to the **Dependency Inversion Principle**, where high-level modules (your repositories) should not depend on low-level modules (the ORM implementation), but both should depend on abstractions.

#### 2. Enhancing Testability:
When your repositories depend on an interface, you can easily create mock or fake implementations of `IDbContext` in your unit tests.
This allows you to test your repository logic in complete isolation, without needing to connect to a real database, making your tests faster and more reliable.

#### 3. Enforcing a Clean Architecture:
`IDbContext` acts as a boundary.
Your application and domain layers can reference the `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions` package to use `IDbContext`, while the concrete `DbContext` implementation resides in your infrastructure layer.
This prevents your core business logic from having a direct dependency on infrastructure concerns.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It's Used in Practice
A custom repository depends on `IDbContext`, even if the underlying base repository implementation needs to cast it back to a concrete `DbContext` to function.

## üß† Summary
In summary, `IDbContext` is a simple but powerful tool for creating a clean, maintainable, and testable data access layer by abstracting away the specific details of the database context implementation.
