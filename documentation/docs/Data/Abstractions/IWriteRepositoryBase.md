The `IWriteRepositoryBase<T>` interface is a specialized contract that defines a set of **write-only** operations for a generic repository.
Its primary purpose is to provide a standardized way to create, update, and delete entities in a data source.

This design is a direct application of the **Command Query Separation (CQS)** principle, which states that methods should either be *commands* that change the state of the system (like the ones in this interface) or *queries* that return data, but not both.

## üîë Key Features and Benefits

#### 1. Enforces Write-Only Access
By depending on this interface, a service can be explicitly designed to only modify data, preventing it from performing read operations. This creates a clear and secure separation of concerns.

#### 2. Provides Standard Mutation Methods
It defines a comprehensive set of methods for all common data modification tasks:
*   `AddAsync` / `AddRangeAsync`: For creating one or more entities.
*   `UpdateAsync` / `UpdateRangeAsync`: For modifying existing entities.
*   `DeleteAsync` / `DeleteRangeAsync`: For removing entities.

#### 3. Promotes a Clean Architecture
It allows you to build services that are clearly defined as "command handlers," whose sole responsibility is to change the state of the application, leading to a more maintainable and understandable architecture.
