The primary purpose of the `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions` package is to establish a clean,
decoupled, and testable data access layer for your applications.
It achieves this by providing a set of essential,
reusable interfaces for common data access patterns, namely the **Repository** and **Unit of Work** patterns.

By programming against these abstractions instead of concrete implementations (like Entity Framework Core),
your application's business logic remains independent of the underlying database technology.

## üîë Key Benefits and Features
As outlined in its documentation, using this package provides several key advantages:

#### 1. Decouples Your Application Layers:
Your business logic will depend on interfaces like `IRepositoryBase<T>`, not on a specific data access framework.
This makes it easier to swap out data access technologies in the future if needed.

#### 2. Improves Testability:
When your services depend on interfaces, you can easily provide mock implementations in your unit tests.
This allows you to test your business logic in isolation without needing a real database.

#### 3. Enforces Consistency:
It promotes a standardized way to perform data operations across your entire application, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.
Async-First Design: All data operations defined in the interfaces are asynchronous, which encourages the development of scalable and responsive applications.

#### 4. Async-First Design:
All data operations defined in the interfaces are asynchronous, which encourages the development of scalable and responsive applications.


## ‚≠ïÔ∏è Core Components
The package provides the following key interfaces:

* **`IRepositoryBase<T>`**:
A generic interface that defines standard CRUD (`Create`, `Read`, `Update`, `Delete`) operations for any entity.
It provides methods like `GetByIdAsync`, `GetAllAsync`, `AddAsync`, `Update`, and `Remove`.
* **IDbContext**: An abstraction for the `DbContext` itself, allowing repositories to depend on an interface rather than a concrete `DbContext` class.

## üß© How It Fits into the Ecosystem
This package is a foundational part of the `RA.Utilities` data access strategy.

  * It depends on **[`RA.Utilities.Data.Entities`](../Entities/index.mdx)** to provide the base structure for entities that the repositories will manage.
  * It is implemented by **[`RA.Utilities.Data.EntityFramework`](../EntityFramework/index.mdx)**, which contains the concrete repository and unit of work classes that use Entity Framework Core.


## üß† Summary

In summary, `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions` provides the essential contracts for building a robust, modern, and maintainable data access layer, forming the bridge between your application logic and your data persistence infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions
```

## üîó Dependencies

-   **[`RA.Utilities.Data.Entities`](../Entities/index.mdx)**:
This package provides the base `IEntity` interface and `BaseEntity` class required by the repository pattern.
