# RA.Utilities.Data.Entities

[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RA.Utilities.Data.Entities.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Data.Entities/)

The primary purpose of the `RA.Utilities.Data.Entities` package is to provide a standardized and reusable foundation for data entities within your applications.
It establishes a common structure for all your data models, which helps to reduce repetitive (boilerplate) code and enforce consistency across your project.

## Base Classes for Common Properties:
The package provides several base classes that you can inherit from, so you don't have to redefine common properties in every single entity class you create.

* **BaseEntity**:
This is the most fundamental base class.
When your entity inherits from it, it automatically gets properties for its unique identifier and timestamps (`Id`, `CreatedDate`, `UpdatedDate`).
* **AuditableBaseEntity**:
This class inherits from `BaseEntity` and adds properties to track who created or modified the entity (`CreatedBy`, `LastModifiedBy`).
This is very useful for auditing purposes.
* **SoftDeleteEntity**:
This class also inherits from `BaseEntity` and adds an `IsDeleted` flag.
This enables "soft-delete" functionality, where records are marked as deleted but not physically removed from the database, preserving data history.

## üß© How It Fits into the Ecosystem
The `RA.Utilities.Data.Entities` package is a foundational piece of the `RA.Utilities` ecosystem.
The abstractions it provides are consumed by other packages, such as `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions` and `RA.Utilities.Data.EntityFramework`.

In short, `RA.Utilities.Data.Entities` solves the common problem of defining the basic structure of data models,
allowing you to focus on the unique properties of your entities while ensuring a consistent and maintainable data layer.

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
