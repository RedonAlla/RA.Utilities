`RA.Utilities.Core` is a lightweight .NET library designed to enhance error handling by providing a functional `Result` type.
It helps you write cleaner, more predictable, and more robust code by avoiding exceptions for expected operational failures.
This approach allows for a clear and explicit representation of success or failure, making your application's control flow easier to follow and maintain.

## 🎯 Purpose

In many applications, exceptions are used for both unexpected system faults (e.g., [`NullReferenceException`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullreferenceexception)) and predictable business-level failures (e.g., "user not found").
This can lead to complex `try-catch` blocks and makes it difficult to distinguish between recoverable errors and true exceptions.

The [`Result`](./Results.md) type solves this by providing a wrapper that explicitly represents one of two outcomes:

- **Success**: The operation completed successfully, and may contain a value.
- **Failure**: The operation failed, and contains an [`Exception`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.exception) detailing the error.

This pattern encourages you to handle failures as part of your normal code flow, leading to more readable and resilient applications.

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Core
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Core
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

## When to use Results Pattern and when to use Exceptions 

| Layer	               | Use Results Pattern | Use Exceptions |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | -------------- |
| ✅ Application Layer | ✅ Yes              | ❌ Avoid       |
| ✅ Domain Layer      | ✅ Yes              | ❌ Avoid       |
| 🌐 Infrastructure    | ❌ Rarely           | ✅ Yes         |
| 🌍 External APIs     | ❌                  | ✅ Required    |
| 🧪 Tests             | ✅ Preferred        | ✅ Avoid       |

| Situation	                    | Use               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Input validation failed       | ✅ Result pattern |
| Business rule not satisfied   | ✅ Result pattern |
| DB connection failed          | ⚠️ Exception      |
| File not found (unexpected)   | ⚠️ Exception      |
| You want to chain logic steps | ✅ Result pattern |
| You need a stack trace.       | ⚠️ Exception      |

## The Result Type

- [`Result`](./Results.md#result-class): Represents the outcome of an operation that does not return a value.
It can be either a success or a failure.
- [`Result<T>`](./Results.md#resulttresult-class): Represents the outcome of an operation that returns a value of type `T`.
It can be a success holding a `T` value, or a failure holding an `Exception`.

#### Factory Methods

- [`Result.Success()`](./Results.md): Creates a success result.
- `Result.Failure(Exception exception)`: Creates a failure result.
