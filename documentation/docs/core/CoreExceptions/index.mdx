# RA.Utilities.Core.Exceptions

[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RA.Utilities.Core.Exceptions.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Core.Exceptions/)

`RA.Utilities.Core.Exceptions` provides a set of standardized, semantic exceptions for use across the RA.Utilities ecosystem. These exceptions, such as `NotFoundException` and `ConflictException`, allow for clear, intent-driven error handling in your business logic.

## üéØ Purpose

Instead of throwing generic `Exception` or `ArgumentException` types, this package provides exceptions that carry semantic meaning about what went wrong. This approach has several key benefits:

- **Clear Intent**: Throwing a `NotFoundException` is more descriptive than a generic exception with a "not found" message.
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Middleware (like in `RA.Utilities.Api`) can catch these specific exception types and automatically map them to the correct HTTP status codes and structured error responses (e.g., 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict).
- **Decoupled Logic**: Your domain or application layer can focus on business rules and throw semantic exceptions without needing to know about HTTP details. The web layer handles the translation.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Eliminates the need for repetitive `try-catch` blocks in your controllers for common error scenarios.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Core.Exceptions
