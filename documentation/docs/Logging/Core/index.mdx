The `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core` package provides a **one-line, opinionated setup for production-ready structured logging using Serilog**.

Its primary purpose is to abstract away the repetitive boilerplate code required to configure a robust logging
solution in a modern .NET application.
Instead of manually configuring sinks, enrichers, and performance settings,
developers can call a single extension method to get a "batteries-included" logger.

## üîë Here are the key features it provides out of the box:

  * **Structured Logging**:
  It configures Serilog to write logs in a structured format (like JSON),
  which is essential for effective querying and analysis in log management systems.
  * **Pre-configured Sinks**:
  It sets up common logging destinations:
    * **A Console sink** for easy viewing during development.
    * **A rolling File** sink for persistent log storage.
  * **Asynchronous Performance**:
  It wraps the sinks in `Serilog.Sinks.Async` to minimize the performance impact of logging on your application's main threads.
  * **Rich Enrichment**: It automatically includes valuable context in every log message:
    * **Exception Details**: Destructures exceptions to include full stack traces.
    * **Sensitive Data Masking**:
    Automatically finds and masks sensitive data (like passwords or credit card numbers) before they are written to the logs.
  * **Configuration-Driven**: It reads settings from the `Serilog` section of `appsettings.json`, allowing log levels to be adjusted without code changes.

## üß† Summary
In short, `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core` is the implementation engine that makes logging easy.
It works hand-in-hand with `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared` (which defines what the logs look like) to provide a complete and consistent logging strategy for your entire ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Logging.Core
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Logging.Core
```
