# RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared

[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared/)

The `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared` package serves as a **foundational library that provides common,
shared data models for logging HTTP interactions**.

Its primary purpose is to define the "shape" or "schema" for your structured logs.
By providing a consistent set of C# classes (`BaseHttpLogTemplate`, `HttpRequestLogTemplate`, `HttpResponseLogTemplate`),
it ensures that any component in your ecosystem that logs an HTTP request or response does so in a standardized format.

## üîë Here‚Äôs a breakdown of its key roles:

### 1. Defines the Contract for Logs:
It contains the POCO (Plain Old C# Object) classes that represent the data you want to capture for an HTTP interaction,
such as the path, headers, status code, and body.

### 2. Ensures Consistency:
It's a shared dependency for other packages like `RA.Utilities.Api.Middlewares` (for logging incoming API requests) and
`RA.Utilities.Integrations` (for logging outgoing HttpClient requests).
This guarantees that a log entry for an incoming request has the same structure as a log entry for an outgoing one,
making logs much easier to query and correlate.

### 3. Decouples Data from Implementation:
This package only defines what the log data looks like.
It has no dependency on a specific logging provider (like Serilog or NLog).
The actual work of writing the log is handled by other packages (like `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core`), which consume these shared models.


## üß† Summary
In short, `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared` is the "blueprint" for your HTTP logs,
promoting consistency and clean architecture by separating the data model from the logging implementation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared
```
