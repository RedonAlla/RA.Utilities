Packages `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core` and `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared packages`.
They work together to provide a comprehensive and standardized logging solution for your applications.

## `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared`
The purpose of this package is to be a **foundational library that provides common,
shared data models for logging HTTP interactions**.

  * **Core Function**:
  It defines the "shape" of your log data.
  It contains the C# classes (`BaseHttpLogTemplate`, `HttpRequestLogTemplate`, `HttpResponseLogTemplate`)
  that represent the structure of an HTTP request and response log entry.
  * **Ensures Consistency**:
  By providing these common models, it guarantees that any part of your ecosystem that logs an HTTP request
  (like a middleware or a delegating handler) will do so in a consistent, structured format.
  * **Not for Direct Use**:
  You typically wouldn't install or use this package directly in your application.
  Instead, it's a dependency that other `RA.Utilities` packages (like `RA.Utilities.Api.Middlewares` or `RA.Utilities.Integrations`)
  rely on.

In short, `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared` is the blueprint for what your HTTP logs should look like.

## `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core`
The purpose of this package is to provide a one-line setup for production-ready structured logging using Serilog.

  * **Core Function**:
  This is the package that contains the actual logging implementation and configuration logic.
  It takes the data models from `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared` and uses a logging provider (like Serilog)
  to write them to a destination (like the console, a file, or a log management system).
  * **Simplifies Setup**:
  It's designed to be the main entry point for developers to configure logging.
  It likely contains extension methods that you would call in your `Program.cs` to get a complete logging setup with minimal effort.
  * **Opinionated Configuration**: It provides a pre-configured, "batteries-included" logging setup that follows best practices for structured logging in a web API environment.

In short, `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core` is the engine that does the logging,
making it easy to get a powerful logging system up and running quickly.

## ⚙️ How They Work Together
1. `RA.Utilities.Logging.Shared` defines the `HttpRequestLogTemplate` class.
2. A component like the `RequestResponseLoggingHandler` from `RA.Utilities.Integrations`
populates an instance of `HttpRequestLogTemplate` with data from an outgoing [`HttpClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) request.
3. The handler then passes this structured object to a logger.
The logger, configured by `RA.Utilities.Logging.Core`, takes the object and uses Serilog
to serialize it into a structured format (like JSON) and write it to the configured log output.

This separation of concerns is excellent, as it decouples the shape of the log data from the *implementation* of the logger itself.
