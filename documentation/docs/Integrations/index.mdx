The primary purpose of the `RA.Utilities.Integrations` package is to simplify and standardize how you make HTTP calls to external APIs in your .NET applications.

It builds on top of Microsoft's recommended [`IHttpClientFactory`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory)
pattern to provide a structured, reusable, and resilient way to manage these integrations.

Here are the key problems it aims to solve:

* **Standardizes Configuration**: It allows you to centralize all your HTTP client settings (like Base URL, timeouts, and API keys) in your `appsettings.json` file, keeping configuration separate from your code.
* **Simplifies Registration**: It provides a single extension method, [`AddHttpClientIntegration`](./Extensions/DependencyInjectionExtensions.md#addhttpclientintegration), which handles all the boilerplate of registering a typed [`HttpClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient), binding the configuration, and adding common policies like logging and retries.
* **Promotes Best Practices**: It encourages using typed [`HttpClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient), which gives you compile-time safety and better IntelliSense when making API calls.
* **Improves Resilience**: It comes with built-in support for transient fault handling using a default Polly retry policy (with exponential backoff), making your application more robust against temporary network issues.

In short, this package provides a "batteries-included" solution for integrating with external services, saving you from writing repetitive setup code and ensuring all your API clients are configured consistently and correctly.
