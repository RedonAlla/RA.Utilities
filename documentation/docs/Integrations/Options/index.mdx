```bash
Namespace: RA.Utilities.Integrations.Options
```

The `RA.Utilities.Integrations.Options` namespace serve a critical role in standardizing and simplifying the
configuration of [`HttpClient`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) instances used for external API integrations.

Their primary purpose is to act as **strongly-typed configuration models**. 
Instead of scattering settings like URLs, timeouts, and API keys throughout your code, you define them in these dedicated "options" classes.
This approach is central to the .NET configuration pattern, where these classes are typically populated from `appsettings.json`.

Let's break down the purpose by looking at the key classes you've provided:

## 1. [`BaseApiSettings<T>`](./ProxySettings.md)
This abstract class is the cornerstone of the namespace.
Its purpose is to provide a standardized, reusable foundation for any API integration's settings.

  * **Enforces Consistency**:
  It ensures that every integration setting will have a common set of essential properties like `BaseUrl`, `Timeout`, and `MediaType`.
  This is enforced by its implementation of the [`IIntegrationSettings`](../Abstractions/IIntegrationSettings.md) interface.
  * **Strongly-Typed Endpoints**:
  The generic parameter `T` for the `Actions` property is a clever design choice.
  It allows you to define a class that holds the specific endpoint paths for an API, preventing "magic strings" in your code and enabling autocompletion.
  * **Validation**:
  It uses Data Annotations (`[Required]`, `[Url]`, `[Range]`) to ensure that the configuration provided is valid at application startup, preventing runtime errors due to misconfiguration.

## 2. [`ProxySettings`](./ProxySettings.md)
This class is a perfect example of a focused options model.
Its sole purpose is to hold all the configuration details required to set up an HTTP proxy.

  * **Decoupling**:
  By having a dedicated `ProxySettings` class, the logic for handling proxies is separated from the API-specific settings.
  An integration can simply include these settings if it needs proxy support.
  * **Clarity**:
  It makes the configuration explicit.
  A developer looking at `appsettings.json` can immediately understand what values are needed to configure the proxy.

## ðŸ§  Summary
In short, the classes in the `RA.Utilities.Integrations.Options` namespace are the "control panel" for your external API integrations.
They provide a structured, validated, and reusable way to define *how* your application connects to the outside world, promoting clean architecture and making your configuration easy to manage.
