The `RA.Utilities.Integrations.Abstractions` namespace serves a similar purpose to the abstractions in other parts of your solution
(like `RA.Utilities.Data.Abstractions`): it defines the core **contracts** and **base types** for the integration layer.

The primary goal of these abstractions is to promote loose coupling and standardization when configuring and using HTTP clients.
By defining interfaces and base classes, the package ensures that different parts of your application can depend on a common contract rather than a specific,
concrete implementation.

In summary, the classes and interfaces within `RA.Utilities.Integrations.Abstractions` provide the fundamental
building blocks and contracts that allow the rest of the `RA.Utilities.Integrations` package to be configurable,
extensible, and easy to use in a standardized way.
