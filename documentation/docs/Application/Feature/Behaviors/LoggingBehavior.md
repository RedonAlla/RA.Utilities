`LoggingBehavior` is an implementation of the [`IPipelineBehavior`](../Abstractions/IPipelineBehavior.md) interface.
Its primary purpose is to act as a "middleware" within your CQRS pipeline to automatically log requests and their corresponding responses.

It elegantly solves the cross-cutting concern of logging by intercepting every command and query that is sent through the mediator.
This provides several key benefits:

1. **Reduces Boilerplate**:
You no longer need to add logging statements to the beginning and end of every single [`IRequestHandler`](../Abstractions//IRequestHandler.md).
The behavior handles it for you.

2. **Enforces Consistency**:
It ensures that every request is logged in a uniform, structured format, making your logs predictable and easier to analyze.

3. **Provides Rich Diagnostics**: By using structured logging (`{@Request}`, `{@Response}`), it captures the entire request and response objects, not just a simple message.
This is incredibly valuable for debugging and tracing the flow of data through your system.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
It keeps your business logic (in the handlers) clean and completely separate from the infrastructure concern of logging.

The file `LoggingBehavior.cs` provides two versions of the class to handle both requests that return a value (`LoggingBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>`) and those that do not (`LoggingBehavior<TRequest>`).
