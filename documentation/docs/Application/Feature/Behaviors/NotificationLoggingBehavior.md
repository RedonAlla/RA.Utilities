`NotificationLoggingBehavior` is an implementation of the [`INotificationBehavior`](../Abstractions/INotificationBehavior.md) interface.
Its primary purpose is to act as a "middleware" in your CQRS pipeline to automatically log the handling of notifications (events).

When a notification is published, this behavior intercepts it before it reaches its [`INotificationHandler`](../Abstractions/INotificationHandler.md)(s).
This provides several key benefits for your event-driven logic:

1. **Reduces Boilerplate:**
You don't need to add logging statements to every [`INotificationHandler`](../Abstractions/INotificationHandler.md).
The behavior does it for you.

2. **Enforces Consistency**:
It ensures that all notification handling is logged in a uniform way, making it easier to trace event flows in your system.

3. **Provides Diagnostic Insight**:
It gives you a clear trace of which events are being published and processed, which is invaluable for debugging complex, asynchronous workflows.

4. **Separation of Concerns**:
It cleanly separates the business logic of your event handlers from the cross-cutting concern of logging.
