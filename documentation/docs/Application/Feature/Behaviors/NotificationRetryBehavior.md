`NotificationRetryBehavior` is an implementation of the [`INotificationBehavior`](../Abstractions/INotificationBehavior.md) interface.
Its primary purpose is to add resilience to your event handling system by automatically retrying failed notification handlers.

When a notification is published, it's processed by its handlers.
Sometimes, a handler might fail due to a transient issue, such as a temporary network problem, a database deadlock, or a brief service unavailability.
Instead of immediately failing and logging an error, this behavior intercepts the exception and retries the operation.

## üõ†Ô∏è How it works:

1. **Intercepts Execution**:
It wraps the call to your [`INotificationHandler`](../Abstractions/INotificationHandler.md)(s) (represented by the `next` delegate) inside a try-catch block within a loop.

2. **Retries on Failure**:
If an exception occurs, the catch block is executed.
It logs that an attempt failed and then waits for a short, increasing duration (a linear backoff strategy: 200ms, 400ms, etc.).

3. **Sets a Limit**:
It will retry up to a maximum number of times (hard-coded to 3).
If all retries fail, the final exception is allowed to propagate up the stack.

4. **Succeeds on Pass**:
If any attempt succeeds, the loop breaks, and the process continues normally.

This behavior is crucial for building robust, self-healing systems, as it can automatically recover from temporary glitches without manual intervention.
