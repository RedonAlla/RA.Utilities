Namespace: RA.Utilities.Feature.Models
```

The `RA.Utilities.Feature.Models` namespace primarily defines delegates that are fundamental to implementing the pipeline behaviors within the `RA.Utilities.Feature` library.

## âœ¨ Here's a breakdown of their purpose:

### 1. `NotificationHandlerDelegate`:

* **Purpose**:
This delegate represents an asynchronous callback that invokes the next [`INotificationHandler`](../Abstractions/INotificationHandler.md)(s)
in the notification processing pipeline.
* **Usage**:
It's used within [`INotificationBehavior`](../Abstractions/INotificationBehavior.md) implementations
(like [`NotificationLoggingBehavior`](../Behaviors/NotificationLoggingBehavior.md)) as the next parameter.
When a behavior calls await next(), it's essentially telling the pipeline to proceed with the execution of the actual notification handlers or the next behavior in the chain.
This allows behaviors to execute logic both before and after the core notification handling.

### 2. `RequestHandlerDelegate` and `RequestHandlerDelegate<TResponse>`:

* **Purpose**:
These delegates represent asynchronous callbacks for invoking the next `IRequestHandler`(s) in the request processing pipeline.
They are designed to work seamlessly with the `Result` pattern from `RA.Utilities.Core`.
* **`RequestHandlerDelegate()`**:
Used for requests that do not return a specific data type, but still need to indicate success or failure using `Result`.
* **`RequestHandlerDelegate<TResponse>()`**:
Used for requests that are expected to return a specific data type (`TResponse`), wrapped in a `Result<TResponse>` to indicate success or failure.
* **Usage**:
They are used within [`IPipelineBehavior`](../Abstractions/IPipelineBehavior.md) implementations
(like [`ValidationBehavior`](../Behaviors//ValidationBehavior.md)) as the next parameter.
Similar to `NotificationHandlerDelegate`, calling `await next()` allows the pipeline behavior to pass control to the subsequent handlers or behaviors, enabling the application of cross-cutting concerns (e.g., validation) before and after the main request handling logic.

## ðŸ§  Summary

In essence, the classes (which are delegates in this case) in `RA.Utilities.Feature.Models` provide
the necessary contractual types for building flexible and extensible processing pipelines for both notifications and requests,
enabling the "middleware" pattern for CQRS and event-driven architectures.
