Namespace: RA.Utilities.Feature.Abstractions
```

The classes within the `RA.Utilities.Feature.Abstractions` namespace are the foundational base handlers for implementing the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern.

## âœ¨ Purpose and Function

Their primary purpose is to provide abstract base classes that your concrete command and query handlers can inherit from.
This approach is central to the Vertical Slice Architecture that the `RA.Utilities` library promotes.

By inheriting from these base handlers, you gain several key benefits "for free" without writing any boilerplate code:

1. **Automatic Logging**: The base handlers automatically log the start and end of every request they process, providing consistent and valuable diagnostic information.
2. **Robust Exception Handling**: Any unhandled exception that occurs within your handler's business logic is automatically caught.
It is then wrapped in a `Result.Failure` object (from the [`RA.Utilities.Core`](../../../core/UtilitiesCore/index.mdx) package),
ensuring your application doesn't crash and returns a predictable error response.
3. **Consistent Structure**: They enforce a consistent structure for all your handlers by providing a single `HandleAsync` method that you must override.
This is where you place your core business logic.

The main abstractions mentioned are:

* **[`IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`](../Abstractions/IRequestHandler.md)**: The most common base handler.
It's used for features that process a request and are expected to return a value (e.g., creating a user and returning their ID, or fetching a product and returning its data).
* **[`IRequestHandler<TRequest>`](../Abstractions/IRequestHandler.md)**: A base handler for "fire-and-forget" operations that process a request but do not return a value (e.g., queuing a background job).

## ðŸ§  Summary
In summary, the `RA.Utilities.Feature.Abstractions` classes are the cornerstone of the CQRS pattern in this framework, providing a robust, consistent, and low-boilerplate foundation for all your business logic features.
