RA.Utilities provides a set of reusable, opinionated building blocks primarily aimed at solving common problems in web API development. The high-level purpose is to reduce boilerplate code, enforce consistency, promote a clean architecture (specifically Vertical Slice Architecture using the CQRS pattern), and improve the overall developer experience.
The repository is structured into several solution folders, each mapping to a specific architectural layer:
 * **Api/**: Contains projects related to the web layer, including API setup, custom middlewares, authentication/authorization helpers, and OpenAPI (Swagger) configuration.
 * **Application/**: Holds the RA.Utilities.Feature project, which is the core of the application logic and implements the CQRS pattern.
 * **Core/**: Contains foundational projects with minimal dependencies, such as shared exceptions and constants.
 * **Data/**: Represents the data access layer, with projects for abstractions and a specific implementation using Entity Framework.
 * **Infrastructure/**: Houses projects that interact with external systems, like standardizing calls to other APIs.
 * **Logging/**: Isolates logging as a cross-cutting concern into its own projects.
 * **documentation/**: Includes documentation as a first-class citizen within the solution.


The solution is broken down into several NuGet packages, each addressing a specific concern like **API & Web**, **Application Logic**, **Core Building Blocks**, **Data Access**, **Integrations**, and **Logging**. In essence, RA.Utilities acts as a "batteries-included" framework to help developers build modern .NET APIs by providing a foundation for a clean architecture, allowing them to focus more on business logic rather than infrastructure setup. The repository is public, licensed under the MIT license, and uses C#.
