# RA.Utilities.Authorization

[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RA.Utilities.Authorization.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Authorization/)

`RA.Utilities.Authorization` offers a streamlined approach to handling user authentication and authorization in ASP.NET Core applications.
It provides a strongly-typed, injectable service to easily access the current user's claims, such as user ID, name, and roles, directly from the `HttpContext`.
This utility simplifies the process of retrieving authenticated user data, reducing boilerplate code and improving the readability and maintainability of your authorization logic.

## üéØ Purpose

In any ASP.NET Core application that requires authentication, you often need to access information about the currently logged-in user.
This typically involves injecting `IHttpContextAccessor` and manually parsing claims from `HttpContext.User`.

This package abstracts that logic away into a clean, reusable, and testable service, `ICurrentUser`.

The main benefits are:
- **Simplified Access**: No more `IHttpContextAccessor` in your controllers and services. Just inject `ICurrentUser`.
- **Strongly-Typed**: Get the user's ID as a `Guid` or `int` without manual parsing and type conversion.
- **Testable**: Easily mock `ICurrentUser` in your unit tests to simulate different authenticated users and scenarios.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Drastically cuts down on repetitive code for accessing user claims.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Authorization
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Authorization
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
