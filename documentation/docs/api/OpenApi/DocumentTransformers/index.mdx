Some hook provided that allows you to programmatically modify the generated OpenAPI (Swagger) document.

*Document Transformers* offers a clean, powerful, and maintainable way to handle cross-cutting API documentation concerns. 
It helps you keep your endpoint definitions focused on their primary logic while ensuring your OpenAPI specification is complete, consistent, and accurate.

Your library provides several concrete implementations that solve common problems:

### 1. [`BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer`](./BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer):

  * **Problem**: Manually configuring every protected endpoint to show the "Authorize" lock icon and JWT Bearer security scheme in Swagger UI is repetitive.
  * **Solution**: This transformer automatically inspects your application's registered authentication schemes.
  If it finds a "Bearer" scheme, it programmatically adds the correct security definition and security requirement to the OpenAPI document.
  The result is that the "Authorize" button appears automatically in Swagger UI, allowing developers to easily test protected endpoints.

### 2. [`HeadersParameterTransformer`](./HeadersParameterTransformer):

  * **Problem**: Your API requires certain headers on every request for traceability (like `x-request-id`).
  Documenting this on every single endpoint is tedious and error-prone.
  * **Solution**: This transformer iterates through every operation in the OpenAPI document and automatically adds the configured request and response headers (like `x-request-id`).
  This ensures your API contract is consistently and accurately documented everywhere without cluttering your endpoint code.

### 3. [`ResponsesDocumentTransformer`](./ResponsesDocumentTransformer):

  * **Problem**: Your API uses standardized error responses from RA.Utilities.Api.Results for common status codes (`400`, `404`, `409`, `500`).
  You want your Swagger documentation to reflect these exact response structures for all endpoints.
  * **Solution**: This transformer automatically adds these common error responses to every operation in the document, using the correct schemas from your results library.
  This saves you from adding multiple `[ProducesResponseType]` attributes to every action.

### 4. `DocumentInfoTransformer`:

  * **Problem**: API metadata like the title, version, and description are hard-coded in `Program.cs`.
  * **Solution**: This transformer pulls that information directly from your `appsettings.json` configuration.
  This allows you to change your API's documented title or version without recompiling the code.
