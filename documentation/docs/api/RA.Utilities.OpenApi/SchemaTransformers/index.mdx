Namespace: RA.Utilities.OpenApi.SchemaTransformers
```

While `DocumentTransformers` modify the entire OpenAPI document and OperationTransformers modify individual endpoints,
the classes in the `RA.Utilities.OpenApi.SchemaTransformers` namespace are even more granular.

They implement the [`IOpenApiSchemaTransformer`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.openapi.iopenapischematransformer) interface,
which is designed to modify the generated schema for a specific data model (a C# `Type`) within your OpenAPI specification.

This allows for powerful, type-specific enhancements that enrich your API documentation automatically.

Based on the files, this namespace contains the following key transformers:

### [`FluentValidationSchemaTransformer`](./FluentValidationSchemaTransformer.md)
This is a highly useful transformer that bridges the gap between your business logic's validation rules and your API documentation.

### [`EnumXmlSchemaTransformer`](./EnumXmlSchemaTransformer.md)
This transformer addresses a common pain point with enums in API documentation: making their values understandable.
Its goal is to read the XML documentation comments you've written for your C# `enum` members and append them directly to the enum's schema description in the OpenAPI document.
