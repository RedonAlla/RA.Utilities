Namespace: RA.Utilities.OpenApi.OperationTransformers
```

`DocumentTransformers` modify the entire OpenAPI document at once, types in the `RA.Utilities.OpenApi.OperationTransformers` namespace are designed for more granular control.
They implement the [`IOpenApiOperationTransformer`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.openapi.iopenapioperationtransformer) interface,
which means they are applied to *each individual API operation (i.e., each endpoint)* separately.

This allows for more targeted modifications that only make sense in the context of a single endpoint.

Here is the transformer provided in that namespace:

### [DefaultResponsesOperationTransformer](./DefaultResponsesOperationTransformer.md)
The `DefaultResponsesOperationTransformer` is a specific and targeted utility that automatically adds a standardized OpenAPI
response for the HTTP `500` (Internal Server Error) status code to every single operation in your API.
