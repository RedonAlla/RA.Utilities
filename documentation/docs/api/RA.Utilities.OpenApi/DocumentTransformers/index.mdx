```

The main purpose of these transformers is to automate common and repetitive tasks, enforce consistency, and keep your API endpoint definitions clean.
Instead of manually annotating every endpoint, you can apply these transformations globally.


Here's a breakdown of the transformers included in this package and their purposes:

### [`DocumentInfoTransformer`](./DocumentInfoTransformer.md)
This populates the top-level information of your OpenAPI document, such as the title, version, and description, directly from your `appsettings.json` configuration.
This allows you to update your API's documentation details without changing any code.

### [`BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer`](./BearerSecuritySchemeTransformer.md)
It automatically adds a "Bearer" security scheme to your OpenAPI document if it detects that JWT Bearer authentication is registered in your application.
This enables the "Authorize" button in the Swagger UI, simplifying the testing of protected endpoints.

### [`HeadersParameterTransformer`](./HeadersParameterTransformer.md)
his transformer adds common headers, like `x-request-id` for correlation and tracing, to every API operation.
This is particularly useful for microservices where tracking requests across different services is essential.

### [`PolymorphismDocumentTransformer`](./PolymorphismDocumentTransformer.md)
This transformer correctly represents inheritance in polymorphic types (a base class with several derived classes) within the OpenAPI schema.
It uses the `oneOf` and `discriminator` keywords to help client-side code generators understand the API's data structure.
