The primary goal of this namespace is to enhance the developer experience by providing convenient "shortcut" and "setup" methods.
These extension methods reduce boilerplate code and simplify common API development tasks in ASP.NET Core.
They abstract away setup complexity and provide elegant shortcuts, guiding developers toward writing cleaner, more organized, and more maintainable API code.

The namespace contains two key classes, each serving a distinct purpose:

### 1. [EndpointExtensions](.EndpointExtensions.md)

This class is the engine behind your **Endpoint Registration** Helpers feature.
Its purpose is to declutter your `Program.cs` file by automating the discovery and mapping of API endpoints.
This is a core pattern for implementing a clean Vertical Slice Architecture.

### 2. [EndpointBuilderExtensions](./EndpointBuilderExtensions.md)
This class is designed to improve the developer experience when applying validation to Minimal API endpoints.
It provides a more fluent and readable syntax for adding the [`ValidationEndpointFilter`](../ValidationEndpointFilter.md).
