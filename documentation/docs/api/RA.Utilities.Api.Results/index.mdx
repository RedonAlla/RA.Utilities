`RA.Utilities.Api.Results` provides a standardized set of models for creating consistent API responses within the *RA.Utilities* ecosystem.
This package includes generic wrappers for success, error, and validation failure scenarios, helping to streamline API development and improve client-side handling.

## 🎯 Purpose

When building APIs, it's crucial to have a consistent and predictable response structure.
This package provides a set of ready-to-use C# records that can be returned from your ASP.NET Core controller actions.
These models ensure that every response—whether it's a success, a generic error, or a detailed validation failure—has the same shape, making it easier for clients to parse and handle.

This library is designed to work seamlessly with the other `RA.Utilities` packages, such as [`RA.Utilities.Core.Constants`](../../core/RA.Utilities.Core.Constants/index.mdx)
for status codes and messages.

## 🛠️ Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Api.Results
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Api.Results
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
