# RA.Utilities.Api.Results

[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RA.Utilities.Api.Results.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Api.Results/)

`RA.Utilities.Api.Results` provides a standardized set of models for creating consistent API responses within the *RA.Utilities* ecosystem.
This package includes generic wrappers for success, error, and validation failure scenarios, helping to streamline API development and improve client-side handling.

## üéØ Purpose

When building APIs, it's crucial to have a consistent and predictable response structure.
This package provides a set of ready-to-use C# records that can be returned from your ASP.NET Core controller actions.
These models ensure that every response‚Äîwhether it's a success, a generic error, or a detailed validation failure‚Äîhas the same shape, making it easier for clients to parse and handle.

This library is designed to work seamlessly with the other `RA.Utilities` packages, such as `RA.Utilities.Core.Constants` for status codes and messages.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Api.Results
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package RA.Utilities.Api.Results
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.
