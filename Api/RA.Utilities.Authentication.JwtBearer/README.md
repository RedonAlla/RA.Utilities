`RA.Utilities.Authentication.JwtBearer` is a utility library that simplifies the configuration of JWT Bearer authentication in ASP.NET Core. It solves the problem of having complex, hardcoded authentication setup in your `Program.cs` by allowing you to configure everything from your `appsettings.json` file.

This approach reduces boilerplate code and makes your authentication settings easier to manage across different environments.

## Getting started

Install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Authentication.JwtBearer
```

## ðŸ”— Dependencies

-   [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.aspnetcore.authentication.jwtbearer)

*(Note: This assumes the package is published on NuGet with the name `RA.Utilities.Authentication.JwtBearer`.)*

## Usage

In your `Program.cs` (for minimal APIs) or `Startup.cs`, use the `AddJwtBearerAuthentication` extension method to configure authentication and authorization services.

### `Program.cs` (ASP.NET Core 6+)

```csharp
using RA.Utilities.Authentication.JwtBearer.Extensions;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// 1. Add and configure JWT Bearer authentication using settings from IConfiguration.
// This single call also adds the necessary authorization services.
builder.Services.AddJwtBearerAuthentication(builder.Configuration);

var app = builder.Build();

// 2. Add the authentication and authorization middleware.
app.UseAuth(); // This is a convenience method for app.UseAuthentication() and app.UseAuthorization().

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```

## Configuration

This library reads JWT Bearer options from the `Authentication:Schemes:Bearer` section of your configuration file (e.g., `appsettings.json`).

Here is an example `appsettings.json` configuration:

```json
{
  "Authentication": {
    "Schemes": {
      "Bearer": {
        "Authority": "https://your-identity-provider.com/",
        "Audience": "your-api-audience",
        "TokenValidationParameters": {
          "ValidateIssuer": true,
          "ValidateAudience": true,
          "ValidateLifetime": true,
          "ValidateIssuerSigningKey": true,
          "ClockSkewInSeconds": 30,
          "IssuerSigningKeyString": "your-super-secret-key-that-is-long-enough-for-the-algorithm"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
>
>When using an identity provider (`Authority`), you typically don't need to specify `ValidIssuer`, `ValidAudience`, or `IssuerSigningKey` as these are discovered from the metadata endpoint.
The example above shows settings for both scenarios (using an authority or validating a self-issued token).
>

The library automatically binds these settings to `JwtBearerOptions`. It also provides special handling for:

-   `ClockSkewInSeconds`: Converts this integer value into a `TimeSpan` for `TokenValidationParameters.ClockSkew`.
-   `IssuerSigningKeyString`: Converts this string into a `SymmetricSecurityKey` for `TokenValidationParameters.IssuerSigningKey`.
