# Release Notes for RA.Utilities.Api

## Version 1.0.0-preview.6.31

This release focuses on improving the developer experience by adding new helper methods for success responses and enhancing the documentation to showcase best practices for endpoint implementation.

### ‚ú® New Features & Improvements

*   **Added `SuccessResponse` Helpers**: Introduced a new static `SuccessResponse` class with helper methods (`Ok`, `Created`, `NoContent`, etc.) to simplify the creation of standardized, successful API responses. This complements the existing error response models and promotes a consistent response structure across the entire API.
*   **Improved `README` Documentation**:
    *   Added a new section to the `README.md` detailing the usage of the new `SuccessResponse` helpers.
    *   Updated the endpoint example for using the `Result<T>` type to demonstrate a cleaner, more powerful pattern using both `SuccessResponse.Ok()` for success cases and `ErrorResultResponse.Result` for failure cases.


### üìù Notes

The main goal of this update is to make API endpoint logic cleaner and more readable. By providing dedicated helpers for both success and failure responses, developers can write more expressive and maintainable code while ensuring a consistent API contract for consumers.
