# Release Notes for RA.Utilities.Core.Constants

## Version 1.0.0-preview.6.3

This is the initial release of `RA.Utilities.Core.Constants`, a foundational package designed to eliminate "magic strings" and "magic numbers" by providing a centralized source of truth for common application values.

### âœ¨ Key Features

This package introduces two primary sets of constants to improve code quality and consistency:

*   **`HttpStatusCodes`**:
    *   Provides static integer constants for common HTTP status codes (e.g., `Ok`, `NotFound`, `InternalServerError`).
    *   Improves code readability by replacing numeric codes with descriptive, self-documenting names.

*   **`ResponseMessages`**:
    *   Provides default string messages for common API responses (e.g., success, not found, unauthorized).
    *   Helps maintain a consistent tone and messaging across all API endpoints, improving the consumer experience.

### ðŸš€ Getting Started

Simply add the package to your project and import the `RA.Utilities.Core.Constants` namespace to start using the predefined constants in your controllers, services, and other application components.

```csharp
using RA.Utilities.Core.Constants;

return StatusCode(HttpStatusCodes.NotFound, ResponseMessages.NotFound);
```

This release aims to improve code quality, readability, and maintainability by establishing a consistent set of core values for the RA Utilities ecosystem.
