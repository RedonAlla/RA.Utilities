# RA.Utilities.Core.Constants

[![NuGet version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/RA.Utilities.Core.Constants?logo=nuget&label=NuGet)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RA.Utilities.Core.Constants/)

A centralized and consistent set of core constants for the RA Utilities ecosystem. This package helps streamline development, improve code readability, and reduce "magic strings" and "magic numbers" by providing a single source of truth for common values.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this package is to ensure consistency across different projects and services. By using these predefined constants, you can:

- **Avoid Typos**: Prevent hard-to-find bugs caused by typos in strings or numbers.
- **Improve Readability**: Make your code more self-documenting (e.g., `HttpStatusCodes.NotFound` is clearer than `404`).
- **Simplify Maintenance**: Update a constant in one place, and the change propagates everywhere it's used.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install the package via the .NET CLI:

```bash
dotnet add package RA.Utilities.Core.Constants
```

Or through the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.

## ‚ú® Available Constants

The package currently provides the following static classes:

### `BaseResponseCode`

Contains integer constants for common HTTP status codes, aligning with standard web practices. This class was previously named `HttpStatusCodes`.

| Constant Name         | Value | Category           |
|-----------------------|-------|--------------------|
| `Success`             | 200   | Success (2xx)      |
| `BadRequest`          | 400   | Client Error (4xx) |
| `Unauthorized`        | 401   | Client Error (4xx) |
| `Forbidden`           | 403   | Client Error (4xx) |
| `NotFound`            | 404   | Client Error (4xx) |
| `Conflict`            | 409   | Client Error (4xx) |
| `InternalServerError` | 500   | Server Error (5xx) |


### `BaseResponseMessages`

Contains default string messages for common API responses. This helps maintain a consistent tone and messaging for your API consumers.

| Constant Name       | Message                                                | Category |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `Success`           | "Operation completed successfully."                    | Success  |
| `Created`           | "Resource created successfully."                       | Success  |
| `Updated`           | "Resource updated successfully."                       | Success  |
| `Deleted`           | "Resource deleted successfully."                       | Success  |
| `BadRequest`        | "The request is invalid."                              | Error    |
| `Unauthorized`      | "Authentication failed or is missing."                 | Error    |
| `Forbidden`         | "You do not have permission to access this resource."  | Error    |
| `NotFound`          | "The requested resource was not found."                | Error    |
| `Conflict`          | "A conflict occurred with the current state of the resource." | Error    |
| `InternalServerError` | "An unexpected error occurred on the server."          | Error    |

### `HeaderParameters`

Contains constant strings for common HTTP header names.

| Constant Name   | Value            | Description                                                              |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `XRequestId`    | `"x-request-id"` | Used for request correlation and tracing.                                |
| `TraceId`       | `"trace-id"`     | Used for internal tracing.                                               |
| `Location`      | `"location"`     | Used in responses to redirect or indicate the location of a new resource.|
| `Authorization` | `"Authorization"`| Used for sending authentication credentials.                             |

### `ResponseType` (enum)

This enum provides a standardized, machine-readable vocabulary for the outcome of an API operation. It is used within the JSON response body to give clients a specific, semantic context that is more detailed than an HTTP status code.

| Enum Member    | Description                                                                 | Typical HTTP Status |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `Success`      | The operation was successful.                                               | 200 OK              |
| `Validation`   | The request failed due to invalid input data.                               | 400 Bad Request     |
| `Problem`      | An unexpected problem occurred, often used for RFC 7807 problem details.    | 500 Internal Server |
| `NotFound`     | The requested resource was not found.                                       | 404 Not Found       |
| `Conflict`     | The request conflicts with the current state of the resource.               | 409 Conflict        |
| `Unauthorized` | The request requires user authentication.                                   | 401 Unauthorized    |
| `Error`        | A general, non-specific error occurred during the operation.                | 500 Internal Server |
| `BadRequest`   | The request was malformed or could not be processed for reasons other than validation. | 400 Bad Request     |

#### Example JSON Response

```json
{
  "responseCode": 404,
  "responseType": "NotFound", // From the ResponseType enum
  "responseMessage": "Product with value '99' not found."
}
```

## üöÄ Usage Examples

Here‚Äôs how you can use these constants within an ASP.NET Core controller to create clean and consistent API endpoints.

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using RA.Utilities.Core.Constants; // Import the constants

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet("{id}")]
    public IActionResult GetProduct(int id)
    {
        var product = _productService.GetById(id);

        if (product == null)
        {
            // Use constants for both the status code and the response message
            return NotFound(BaseResponseMessages.NotFound);
        }

        return Ok(product);
    }

    [HttpPost]
    public IActionResult CreateProduct([FromBody] Product newProduct)
    {
        if (!ModelState.IsValid)
        {
            // Use constants for a bad request
            return BadRequest(BaseResponseMessages.BadRequest);
        }

        var createdProduct = _productService.Create(newProduct);

        // Use constants for a 'Created' response
        return StatusCode(201, createdProduct); // Or a custom constant like BaseResponseCode.Created if added
    }
}
```
